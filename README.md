# VIOLA: A Framework for the Automatic Generation of Virtual Analog Audio Plug-ins based on WDFs

Welcome to the official repository for **VIOLA**, a framework designed for the **automatic generation of virtual analog audio plug-ins** using **Wave Digital Filters (WDFs)**. This repository accompanies our paper:  
*"VIOLA: A Framework for the Automatic Generation of Virtual Analog Audio Plug-ins based on WDFs,"* authored by R. Giampiccolo, S. Ravasi, and A. Bernardini, and submitted to the special issue "The Sound of Digital Audio Effects" of the *Journal of the Audio Engineering Society*.

## üìñ About VIOLA

VIOLA simplifies the creation of Virtual Analog audio plug-ins, exploiting the modularity and efficiency of WDFs. Users just have to draw a circuit in LTspice and that's it: VIOLA will generate the audio plug-in making use of the MATLAB Audio Toolbox for the automatic design of the graphic user interface and the conversion of code to C++.

### Features

- **Automatic Plug-in Creation**: Simplify the creation of virtual analog plug-ins from your circuit designs.  
- **Custom LTspice Library**: Design circuits easily with a tailored library of components.  
- **Pre-Built Examples**: Start experimenting with ready-to-use examples.  
- **Audio Examples**: Explore audio demonstrations to hear VIOLA's capabilities.

### Current Status

- **Windows OS**: The codebase is fully functional and available for use.  
- **MacOS Support**: Coming soon.

## üõ†Ô∏è LTspice Component Library

Design and simulate circuits in LTspice using the **custom component library** provided:

- Find the library files in the `ltspice_custom_components/` directory.  
- Explore example circuits in the `windows/Data/Input/Netlist/` directory.
- Test the pre-built audio plug-ins of the `windows/Results/` directory in your DAWs.
